CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) :
We have 3 methods to use CSS styles
1. External
2. Internal
3. Inline


External -> It's basically defined in other file and then imported in the file to use it by accessing the same id defined in the external css file and the id of the div

Inline -> If you gave any changes inside a div or any tag in the same line it self whether it will be defined in external class it will be over ridden by the inline styles changes




Id & class
Id is unique and classes can be common like if you want to apply the same changes in multple places the it will be denoted as class
class is denoted by . in class like .footer { background-color: antiquewhite }

And if you want to define a change that only should be changed only one place then in that case it will be changes by accessing the id
id is denoted by # in class like #footer { background-color: aqua }
