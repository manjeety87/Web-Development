			<th>HTML</th>
				<td><span class="subHead">Hypertext Markup Language</span><br>
					HTML5 (the most current version of HTML) is not a programming language but a markup language; it provides the structure for a web page<br>
					Programming languages give your computer instructions whereas HTML is just a series of codes that tell the Web browser to display text/images/etc. in a certain way. These codes (called tags or elements) surround the content to be displayed.</td>

			<th>CSS</th>
				<td><span class="subHead">Cascading Style Sheet</span><br>
					While HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the formatting and layout for your site.</td>
			</tr>	
			
			<!-- DOM -->
			<tr>
			<th>DOM / Document Object Module</th>
				<td><strong>DOM</strong> is an arrangement of the content of an HTML document into a 
					tree-like structure (the DOM tree). Each part of the HTML document is represented
					by a node on the tree including elements, attributes, and text.<br>

			<!-- cPanel -->
			<tr>
			<th>cPanel</th>
				<td><strong>cPanel</strong> is an online Linux-based web hosting control panel that provides a graphical interface and automation tools designed to simplify the process of hosting a web site. cPanel utilizes a three-tier structure that provides capabilities for administrators, resellers, and end-user website owners to control the various aspects of website and server administration through a standard web browser.<br>

			<!-- Element/Tag/Attribute -->
			<tr>
			<th>Element/Tag/Attribute</th>
				<td>Somethimes <strong><em>element</em></strong> and <strong><em>tag</em></strong> are used interchangeably though there is a difference. An <em>element</em> normally consists of a start tag, content (optional), and an end tag which comprises an element structure (&lt;p&gt;HI&lt;/p&gt;). A <em>tag</em> is just that; a single tag (&lt;p&gt;). An <strong><em>attribute</em></strong> identifies a property for an element and consists of an attribute=value pairing. Attributes always appear within an element's start tag (&lt;img  src='sheridan.png'&gt; where <em>src</em> is the attribute and <em>'sheridan.png'</em> is the value for that attribute). </td>

			<!-- Client-Server Network -->
			<tr>
			<th>Client-Server Network</th>
				<td>Simplified, a server is the host/hub that provides information or a service to a client (end-user). </td>
			</tr>	
			
			<!-- Deprecated features -->
			<tr>
			<th>Deprecated features</th>
				<td>You may see the term "deprecated" for certain HTML and CSS features. This simply means that the feature has been phased out. One example would be the &lt;center&gt; tag. It was replaced with the style "text-align: center;" when HTML5 was released.</td>
			</tr>	

			<!-- Javascript -->
			<tr>
			<th>Javascript</th>
				<td>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br>
