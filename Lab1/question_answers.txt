Q. Explain how to manage website files
Ans. 
Websites use several types of files, including
HTML files, image files, media such as audio and
video files, and CSS files
-> Each site must follow a systematic method to
organize its files
-> The main folder, also called the root folder,
contains all files and other folders for the website
Website files are managed and organized by type
/js
    /classes
    /libs
    /app.js
/css
    /screen.css
    /print.css
/images
    /icons
    /logo.png
/templates
    /mobile
    /base.html

This structure is widely used across frameworks, examples and sites but starts to get messy quickly.
Where would you put a reusable navigation file? or a javascript file that only relates to mobile? 
or a css file for a certain page?

Q. Describe the benefits of validating web documents
Ans.After the creation of an HTML file, the document
is validated to verify the validity of the HTML code
-> A validator checks for errors, indicates where they
    are located, and suggests corrections
-> If the validator detects an error in an HTML code,
    it displays a warning in the header bar
-> A Result line below the header bar shows the
    number of errors in the document
